## About Me

**Data Scientist** with over 3 years of experience in data, specializing in **time series forecasting**, causal inference and spatial analysis using Python.

<!-- I have professional experience in market and business data analysis, which has contributed to the development of strong analytical and data communication skills. 

My Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Economics provided me with a solid foundation in statistical and mathematical modeling, as well as research skills. My undergraduate degree in engineering developed my ability to solve complex problems and learn autonomously.

I work on data science projects utilizing Machine Learning models in Python, covering areas such as sales forecasting, demand price elasticity, as well as customer classification and clustering. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply algorithms with best coding practices to extract insights and guide strategic decisions. -->

## Professional Experiences

- Data Scientist at [Minerva Foods](https://www.linkedin.com/company/minerva-sa/about/), focusing on time series.
- Research Data Scientist for a CNPq project.
- Market Intelligence Analyst at [Ipiranga S.A.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/petroleo-ipiranga/about/)

## Academic Background

- Master's degree in **Applied Economics** with a focus on **time series** and **spatial econometrics**. The [dissertation](https://wp.ufpel.edu.br/ppgom/files/2024/07/versao_final_dissertacao_caio_casagrande_ppgom.pdf) analyzes how Brazilian soybean exports relate to macroeconomic variables, providing insights into the economic impacts of global changes through a multivariate time series methodology.

- Bachelor's degree in Agricultural Engineering with a focus on agribusiness. For my final project, I used R to create **price forecasting models** for key agricultural commodities using the **ARIMA** methodology, published in the [Journal of Economics and Agribusiness](https://doi.org/10.25070/rea.v20i3.14292).

## My Work

Here I highlight some **personal** projects I have worked on throughout my professional career. 

### Econometrics using Python

In addition to my data science work, I also have a strong interest in econometrics. Here are some of my econometric projects:

- **[Using ARIMA to Forecast Olist Revenue](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/arima_revenue):** Applied the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model to predict Olist's revenue for the next 14 days, providing the company with robust forecasting models to improve financial planning and resource optimization. [Read more on Medium](https://medium.com/@caiocasagrande/using-arima-in-python-to-forecast-olist-revenue-3e19fbe6e424).

- **[Price Elasticity of Demand Analysis](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/price_elasticity_of_demand):** Analyzed price-demand elasticity to understand how price variations impact consumer demand for elastic products. This project provides a brief overview of how this economic theory can be applied to real-world scenarios and be a valuable resource for businesses. [Explore the insights with StreamlitApp](https://price-elasticity-caio-casagrande.streamlit.app/). 

### Data Science Portfolio

I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve business problems. Here are some of my recent projects:

#### Classification Projects

- **[InStyle - Customer Classification](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/instyle):** Used different Machine Learning algorithms to train and predict customer satisfaction. The project provided insights and recommendations to classify customers and **predict** dissatisfaction, enabling InStyle to address customer satisfaction issues and improve overall experience.

- **[Cardiovascular Disease Detector](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/cardiovascular_disease):** Created a model to enhance the accuracy of cardiovascular disease diagnosis, improving from 65% to 75% **accuracy**, resulting in a significant **revenue increase** for Cardio Catch Disease.

### Regression Projects

- **[Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/rossmann):** Employed various Machine Learning models and chose the best performing model to forecast sales for Rossmann stores. The project provided a comprehensive step-by-step Data Science project to optimize the resources allocation to renovate Rossmann stores.

- **[Taxi Destination Prediction](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/taxi):** Developed a predictive model to infer the final destination of taxi rides, reducing empty mileage and optimizing operational planning.

#### Clustering Projects

- **[Customer Clustering for Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/mkt_campaign_clustering):** The goal is to enhance business and marketing strategies by clustering customers using the **K-Means** algorithm. This helps understand customer behaviors and preferences, enabling personalized strategies for each group. Benefits include more effective marketing, better customer experience, and optimized resource allocation for maximum business impact.

#### Recommendation System

- **[Beyond "*You May Also Like*": Understanding Consumer Choices](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/customer_behavior):** Conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand purchases, products, consumer temporal behavior, and the price-quantity relationship. Used **Market Basket Analysis** to identify association patterns among products, classifying those frequently bought together, and **Recommendation System** to generate product suggestions for customers based on their similarity to others. This project equips Rex London with information to enhance customer experience through personalized recommendations, potentially increasing sales.

#### Finance Projects

- [Credit Score](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/bank_credit_score): Built an internal risk model to optimize profitability and business security while balancing market expansion, providing key insights on loan approval strategies through credit score decile analysis. [Streamlit](https://credit-scoring-bank-caio-casagrande.streamlit.app/).

- [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/fraud_detection): Developed a fraud detection model using Exploratory Data Analysis, data preparation techniques, and various Machine Learning models, achieving high ***accuracy*** and ***recall*** to confidently identify fraud.

### Data Analysis Projects

- **[Exploratory Data Analysis for Olist](https://github.com/caiocasagrande/olist_eda):** Performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis for Olist, uncovering key business insights related to consumer behavior, customer satisfaction, sales patterns, and regional differences across states. The analysis provided quality and actionable informations to support strategic decision-making.

All my projects are structured around solving business problems, employing regression, clustering, and classification algorithms to deliver optimal solutions. You can read more about them on my [Portfolio Page](caiocasagrande.github.io/portfolio) and find the codes on their repositories. -->
